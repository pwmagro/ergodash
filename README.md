Welcome to the Ergodash git repo! Here you can find hardware and software files, in case you'd like to build your very own Ergodash. Keep posted here for FAQ's, pricing, etc. as they come up.

You may use these files, unmodified, to produce an Ergodash for personal use only. I'll work out a real license later, but until then, any other use is prohibited without explicit permission. Thanks for playing fair :)
